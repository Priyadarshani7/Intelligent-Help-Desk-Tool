On Boarding


Delayed Account Creation


Users may experience access delays when new accounts are not created promptly due to administrative backlogs or system processing issues.


Solution:


Automate Account Setup: Implement automated onboarding tools to generate user accounts in the system as soon as HR finalizes the new hire’s details. This can reduce delays caused by manual entry.

Pre-Onboarding Checklist: Develop a checklist for HR and IT to ensure that account creation, email setup, and software licenses are completed well in advance of the start date.

Follow-Up Reminders: Set automated reminders for HR and IT teams to finalize account setups a few days before the new hire's first day to ensure no delays occur.




Missing System Access


Users may be unable to access required systems or applications due to incorrect permissions, account setup issues, or network problems.
Solution:


Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Use a role-based access management system where user permissions are automatically assigned based on job title or department. This ensures new hires only have access to the tools and information necessary for their role.

Standard Access Templates: Define standard access templates for different job functions (e.g., HR, IT, Marketing, etc.) so that account access can be quickly granted without confusion.

Early IT Involvement: Ensure IT is informed in advance of the new hire’s role and required tools. This proactive approach helps avoid delays and ensures the necessary system access is ready when the new hire begins.


Incomplete Hardware Setup


Users may face issues when hardware components are not properly installed or configured, leading to malfunctioning devices or missing functionality.




Solution:


Maintain Hardware Inventory: Keep a ready inventory of essential hardware like laptops, monitors, headsets, etc. for new hires. This prevents any delays if the required equipment is not available at the time of onboarding.

Track Requests in Ticketing System: Use a ticketing system to track new hardware requests. This way, every request is logged, prioritized, and fulfilled in a timely manner.

Use Setup Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs): Develop a step-by-step guide for IT to ensure consistent hardware setup for each new hire. This helps avoid missing or incorrectly installed peripherals, ensuring a smooth start for the employee.




No Email or Communication Tools Access


Users may be unable to access email or communication tools due to network issues, incorrect account settings, or service outages.


Solution:


Automate Email Creation: Integrate email creation into the onboarding process using automated scripts. This allows new hires to receive their credentials immediately after their accounts are set up.

Pre-Configure Communication Apps: Make sure communication tools (e.g., Microsoft Teams, Slack, Zoom) are pre-configured before the employee’s first day. This ensures they can start communicating with the team without any setup delays.

Test Access Before Joining: A day or two before the new hire joins, perform a final check on their accounts to ensure that email, calendar access, and communication apps are all functional. This helps identify and resolve issues ahead of time.




Lack of Proper Induction/Training

 Users may struggle with job tasks or software usage due to insufficient training or orientation, leading to decreased productivity and errors.


Solution:


Schedule Orientation: Arrange an orientation session on the first day to cover the company's culture, HR policies, IT systems, and specific job expectations. Schedule this in advance and ensure that the necessary people (HR, team leads, etc.) are ready.

Provide Digital Handbooks: Create a digital employee handbook or wiki containing all the key information new hires need to know about policies, tools, software, and company practices. Send this to the new hire before they join.

Assign a Mentor/Buddy: Pair each new hire with a team member (a “buddy”) who can guide them through the first few days and help them with any questions. This reduces the feeling of isolation and accelerates their learning process.




Overwhelming Paperwork


Users may feel stressed or delayed by excessive manual paperwork, leading to inefficiencies and errors in handling tasks or processes.








Solution:


Digital Onboarding: Use an electronic system to send and receive onboarding documents (contracts, tax forms, benefits info, etc.) so that new hires can complete paperwork before their first day.

Streamline Paperwork Process: Consolidate necessary paperwork into a single digital packet to avoid overwhelming the new hire with too many forms.

Provide Clear Instructions: Send detailed instructions or videos on how to fill out the paperwork correctly and where to send it, reducing confusion and mistakes.




Lack of Clear Expectations


Users may face confusion or reduced performance when roles, tasks, or goals are not clearly defined, leading to miscommunication and misunderstandings.


Solution:


Set Clear Job Expectations: During the first few days, hold a one-on-one meeting with the new hire to outline job expectations, goals, and key performance indicators (KPIs).

Provide a Written Job Description: Ensure the new hire has a clear, written description of their job duties, responsibilities, and expected outcomes.

Frequent Check-Ins: Schedule regular check-ins (e.g., weekly) for the first 30-60 days to provide feedback, discuss progress, and clarify any concerns or confusion.




Unclear Introduction to Company Culture


Users may struggle to integrate into the workplace when they are not properly introduced to the company's values, norms, and expectations, affecting collaboration and engagement.




Solution:


Facilitate Introductions: Schedule team introductions, either virtually or in person, to help the new hire feel welcomed and connected. Introduce them to key people they’ll be working with.

Provide Cultural Training: Share materials or videos that explain the company’s core values, workplace culture, and social norms. This helps the new hire integrate into the team more easily.

Encourage Social Integration: Host informal events or “virtual coffee” sessions where new employees can meet colleagues in a casual setting.




Access Issues with External Systems (e.g., Cloud)


Users may encounter difficulties accessing external systems or cloud services due to authentication errors, network issues, or incorrect configuration settings.


Solution:


* Verify Access Early: Confirm with external service providers (e.g., cloud platforms, CRM systems) that the new hire has the proper access set up ahead of time.

* Provide Clear Login Instructions: Give the new hire clear instructions for logging into external systems, and have IT on standby in case there are any access issues.

* Utilize SSO (Single Sign-On): For simplicity and security, integrate all external systems with Single Sign-On, which reduces password fatigue and ensures easy access.



Confusing Workflows and Systems


Users may experience delays and errors when workflows or system processes are not clearly defined, making it difficult to complete tasks efficiently.


Solution:


Offer Training Programs: Provide structured, role-specific training on internal systems and tools, including how to navigate the workflows and processes.

Create Knowledge Base: Develop an accessible knowledge base or help center where the new hire can quickly find answers to common questions and troubleshooting steps.

Support Channels: Make sure there’s a dedicated support team available (e.g., IT support, HR) to guide the new hire through any confusion they might face with systems or workflows.




Off Boarding


Delayed Revocation of Access


Users may continue to have system or account access after leaving a role or company, posing security risks due to delayed or incomplete removal of permissions.


Solution:


Automate Access Revocation: Set up automated systems to immediately disable accounts when an employee’s departure is confirmed. This includes emails, network access, and third-party tools.

Offboarding Checklist: Create a comprehensive checklist to ensure all access (e.g., VPN, cloud services, internal tools) is revoked on the employee’s last day.

Coordinate with IT: Notify the IT department well in advance to allow time for account deactivation and retrieval of company-owned devices.




Unreturned Company Assets


Users may fail to return company property, such as laptops or equipment, after leaving the company, leading to inventory discrepancies or security concerns.


Solution:


Inventory Management: Maintain a detailed inventory of all company assets (laptops, phones, ID cards, etc.) issued to employees.

Set Return Deadline: Have employees return all company property before their last working day, and include this requirement in the offboarding checklist.

Conduct Exit Interviews: Use this opportunity to ensure that all company assets are returned and in good condition.




Knowledge Transfer Gaps


Users may struggle to perform tasks or continue projects when there is a lack of proper knowledge transfer, leaving essential information or processes undocumented.


Solution
Assign a Successor: Identify and train a successor or team member who can take over the employee’s responsibilities.

Document Key Information: Ensure that critical processes, tasks, and login details are documented properly to facilitate knowledge transfer.

Conduct Handover Meetings: Organize a series of meetings between the departing employee and the successor to ensure smooth handover of ongoing tasks.




Final Pay & Benefits Issues


Users may face delays or discrepancies in receiving final paychecks or benefits due to administrative errors or incomplete offboarding processes.


Solution


Clear Communication: Provide the departing employee with a clear breakdown of their final paycheck, unused vacation days, severance (if applicable), and any benefits (healthcare, retirement, etc.).

Ensure Compliance: Verify that all legal requirements for final pay (e.g., taxes, deductions) are met.

Confirm Benefits Status: Clarify the status of benefits (e.g., health insurance, pension) after departure and provide options for continued coverage (COBRA, etc.).




No Exit Interview or Feedback


Users may leave the company without providing valuable insights on their experience, potentially missing opportunities for organizational improvement or employee retention.


Solution:


Conduct Exit Interviews: Schedule exit interviews with HR to understand the employee’s experience and gather valuable feedback on the organization.

Standardized Survey: Implement an anonymous survey for employees leaving to capture honest feedback about their tenure.

Act on Feedback: Review feedback from exit interviews to identify patterns and address any organizational issues that could improve employee retention.




Unclear Continuation of Access to Resources


Users may be unsure whether they retain access to certain systems or resources after a role change, leading to confusion or interruptions in workflow.


Solution:


Set Clear Expectations: Inform departing employees about what resources (email access, file storage, etc.) they will continue to have access to after their departure, and for how long.

Backup Important Files: Ensure that the employee’s important files and emails are backed up and stored securely for future reference.

Disable Unnecessary Access: Remove access to non-essential systems, like internal communication tools, to avoid security risks.




Security Breach Concerns


Users may worry about unauthorized access or data leaks due to vulnerabilities, hacking attempts, or lapses in system security, potentially compromising sensitive information.


Solution:


Conduct a Security Audit: Perform a full security check on the departing employee’s access logs and account activity for any suspicious actions.

Revoke All Privileges: Immediately revoke access to physical and digital systems, including workstations, remote access, and external accounts.

Monitor for Suspicious Activity: Keep monitoring accounts and systems for any unusual activity after the employee’s access has been revoked.




Employee Contact Information Outdated


Users may face communication issues when employee contact details are not updated, leading to missed messages or coordination problems.


Solution:


Update Contact Information: Ensure that the departing employee’s personal contact details (phone number, address, email) are updated for final communications and for tax purposes.

Forwarding Address: Request a forwarding address for any company mail or legal documents that need to be sent after the employee leaves.

Maintain Record for Future Needs: Keep the updated contact information for future reference (e.g., for issuing tax forms or benefits documentation).




Incomplete Project Handover


Users may encounter delays or confusion when a departing employee does not fully transfer project details, causing disruption in ongoing tasks or responsibilities.


Solution:


Handover Documentation: Require the departing employee to complete detailed documentation on the status of ongoing projects, including deadlines, deliverables, and key contacts.

Transfer of Key Relationships: Ensure that the employee has introduced their replacement to any key external or internal stakeholders.

Organize Handover Meetings: Have the employee meet with relevant team members to ensure everyone is up-to-date on the project status.




Inconsistent Offboarding Processes


Users may face confusion or security risks when offboarding steps vary across departments, leading to gaps in access removal, documentation, or asset return.


Solution:


Standardize Offboarding: Develop a standardized offboarding process with clear steps for HR, IT, and managers to follow.

Create an Offboarding Portal: Use a centralized system or portal to track all offboarding activities, such as the return of equipment, access revocation, and exit interviews.

Regularly Update Offboarding Procedures: Continuously review and improve the offboarding process based on feedback from employees and HR.

Delayed Equipment Return During Offboarding

Users may fail to return company-issued equipment on time, causing inventory and security concerns.

Solution:

Set Clear Deadlines: Communicate equipment return deadlines during the offboarding process.

Use Asset Tracking: Maintain a detailed inventory of issued equipment and track returns.

Hold Final Pay: Withhold final paychecks until all equipment is returned.
