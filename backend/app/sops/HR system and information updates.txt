HR should ensure that all employees have proper access to the self-service portal. If access is restricted, HR should investigate the issue and provide solutions, such as password resets or access grants. The portal should be user-friendly and mobile-accessible, allowing employees to view and update their information as needed. HR should regularly review access logs to ensure all employees can access the portal and should offer training on how to use the portal effectively.

HR can also consider offering mobile access to payslips for employees who need quick access to these documents on the go.
